# GoldRushSimulator
made by Joseph Hoff, Brandon Roth <br />

made for the class CSS 432 - Network Design at University of Washington: Bothell, Spring 2014 <br />
the professor was Brent Lagesse <br />

this is a prototype first person networked multiplayer game
this is a Unity C# app that uses Berkeley sockets, not Unity's networking API
this is a ffa game, your goal is to jump around and collect the most floating golden bars

i don't have the source code for this unfortunately...
we worked off Joseph's computer and i forgot to get a copy of it :(

how to play: 
download this project as zip
run the .exe 3 times
with the first .exe, click 'Host' and put it aside
with the second and third .exe, click 'Hello World' at the bottom

the first and second .exe may get kicked back to lobby after joining
it's a bit janky, just keep clicking 'Hello World', it should work eventually :)

you can press the escape button to toggle between using your mouse cursor and moving the in game camera
you can jump with space bar
run around and collect the golden bars
they should dissapear for both clients and the score should get updated
