# GoldRushSimulator
made by Joseph Hoff, Brandon Roth <br />

made for the class CSS 432 - Network Design at University of Washington: Bothell, Spring 2014 <br />
the professor was Brent Lagesse <br />

this is a prototype first person networked multiplayer game <br />
this is a Unity C# app that uses Berkeley sockets, not Unity's networking API <br />
this is a ffa game, your goal is to jump around and collect the most floating golden bars <br />

i don't have the source code for this unfortunately... <br />
we worked off Joseph's computer and i forgot to get a copy of it :( <br />

how to play: <br />
download this project as zip <br />
run the .exe 3 times <br />
with the first .exe, click 'Host' and put it aside <br />
with the second and third .exe, click 'Hello World' at the bottom <br />

the first and second .exe may get kicked back to lobby after joining <br />
it's a bit janky, just keep clicking 'Hello World', it should work eventually :) <br />

you can press the escape button to toggle between using your mouse cursor and moving the in game camera <br />
you can jump with space bar <br />
run around and collect the golden bars <br />
they should dissapear for both clients and the score should get updated <br />
